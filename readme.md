## ü§ñ I am Just a Robot! 
Beep Boop. I am a robot responsible for commiting to some Fairfield Programming Association repositories whenever code styling, and other fun stuff like that, is needed. If you want to use me to commit to your own project, _you can!_ Just use 'runner@fairfieldprogramming.org' as the git email and it'll show me as the person sending the commit. Cheers! ‚úåÔ∏è
